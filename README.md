# Ocean-Flow

Ocean Flow Analysis (OFA)
This Python project analyzes ocean flow data and provides tools for visualization and exploration.

Project Structure
This project consists of three Python files:

ocean_data.py: This file handles loading and preprocessing ocean flow data.
flow_analysis.py: This file contains functions for analyzing ocean flow characteristics, such as speed, direction, and vorticity.
visualization.py: This file provides functions for visualizing ocean flow data using libraries like matplotlib or cartopy (depending on your preference).


Installation
This project requires several Python libraries:

numpy
matplotlib (or cartopy)
(Optional) additional visualization libraries
You can install these libraries using pip:

Bash

pip install numpy matplotlib cartopy
Usage


Load Data:
Python

import ocean_data

data = ocean_data.load_data("path/to/your/data.nc")

# Example data is assumed to be a NetCDF file, adjust based on your format
Analyze Flow:
Python

import flow_analysis

u_velocity, v_velocity = flow_analysis.get_velocities(data)
speed = flow_analysis.calculate_speed(u_velocity, v_velocity)
vorticity = flow_analysis.calculate_vorticity(u_velocity, v_velocity)
Visualize Results:
Python

import visualization

visualization.plot_speed(data["longitude"], data["latitude"], speed)
visualization.plot_vorticity(data["longitude"], data["latitude"], vorticity)
Documentation
For detailed documentation on functions and available parameters, refer to the docstrings within each Python file.
